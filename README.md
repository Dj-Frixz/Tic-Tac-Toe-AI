# Tic-Tac-Toe AI

This simple game lets you play against my AI!

To try it, simply run main.py.
Maybe you manage to beat it... ðŸ‘€

## Known issues
- The window spawned has a fixed size of 1000x1000 so it may appear too big or too tiny on some monitors.
I don't plan to fix it soon.
- The AI isn't _super-optimized_ so it may run slowly on some old hardware.
